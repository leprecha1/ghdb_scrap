# PGD - Python Google Dorks
Retieve dorks from GHDB and link them as incidents once something is being found against a given hostname/ip.

## Scrap script
To start scrapping you should

```shell
[venv]$ python ./ghdb/scrapper.py
``` 

The script will search for dorks from the last 3 years filtering by categories.
